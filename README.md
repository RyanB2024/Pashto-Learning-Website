# LearnPashtoToday — Web App

A lightweight, accessible, responsive website to help users learn Pashto, the native language of Afghanistan.  

## Goals & design principles
- **Accessibility first**: ARIA attributes, keyboard interaction, readable contrast, screen-reader announcement points, and visible focus states.
- **Responsiveness**: Flexible containers and readable typography.
- **Cultural respect**: Content and UI should treat Pashto and Afghan culture with respect — correct diacritics, accurate translations, and contextual notes where necessary.

## Credits & acknowledgements
- Project author: Ryan Blestowe
- All content should be reviewed by a native Pashto speaker for dialectal variance and orthography accuracy.
